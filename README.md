An intelligent conversational assistant built with Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow that comprehends natural language queries and delivers contextually appropriate responses. This ChatBot implementation demonstrates powerful NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts and neural network-based text classification techniques.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process and interpret human language input
- **Intent Classification**: Recognize user intent through neural network classification
- **Response Generation**: Deliver contextually relevant answers from a knowledge base
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintain context throughout dialogue sessions
- **Extensible Architecture**: Simple to enhance with additional intents and responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python 3.7+**: Primary programming language
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing, tokenization, and linguistic analysis
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For state-of-the-art neural network model development and inference
- **JSON**: For storing intents and responses data

## üìã Project Structure

```
ChatBot_python/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intents.json         # Training data with intents and responses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_chatbot.py     # Script for training the neural network
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatbot.py           # Main chatbot implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ words.pkl            # Serialized vocabulary (generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ classes.pkl          # Serialized intent classes (generated)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatbot_model.h5     # Trained neural network model
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Project documentation
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Intent patterns undergo tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
2. **Model Training**: A sophisticated neural network with multiple layers classifies user input into predefined intents
3. **Response Selection**: After identifying an intent, an appropriate response is chosen
4. **Conversation Flow**: The chatbot maintains contextual awareness for coherent multi-turn conversations

## üìä Model Architecture

=================================================================
Dense (Dense)                (None, 128)               XXXX      
_________________________________________________________________
Dropout (Dropout)            (None, 128)               0

The model architecture incorporates multiple dense layers with dropout for regularization, which helps prevent overfitting and enhances generalization to unfamiliar text inputs. This balanced approach ensures robust intent classification while maintaining computational efficiency.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dishant27/ChatBot_python.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd ChatBot_python

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model (if not using pre-trained model)
python train_chatbot.py

# Run the chatbot
python chatbot.py
```

## üí¨ Example Conversation

```
User: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

User: What can you do?
Bot: I can answer questions, provide information, or just chat with you. 
     Feel free to ask me about anything!

User: Tell me about machine learning
Bot: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
     building systems that learn from data. These systems improve their performance
     over time without being explicitly programmed to do so.
```

## üîß Customization

This ChatBot can be easily tailored for specific domains or use cases:

1. Add your own intents and responses in `intents.json`
2. Modify the neural network architecture in `train_chatbot.py`
3. Retrain the model with your custom data
4. Implement domain-specific preprocessing or response generation

## üìà Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques (transformers, word embeddings)
- [ ] Add voice recognition and speech synthesis capabilities
- [ ] Develop a web interface or API for seamless interaction
- [ ] Enhance context handling for more natural conversations
- [ ] Integrate with external knowledge bases or APIs
