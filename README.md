An intelligent conversational agent built with Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow that understands natural language queries and provides contextually relevant responses. This ChatBot implementation demonstrates core NLP (Natural Language Processing) principles and neural network-based text classification.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Process and comprehend human language input
- **Intent Classification**: Identify user intent through neural network classification
- **Response Generation**: Provide contextually appropriate answers from a knowledge base
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintain context across conversation turns
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to expand with new intents and responses

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.7+**: Core programming language
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing, tokenization, and linguistic analysis
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For neural network model training and inference
- **JSON**: For storing intents and responses data

## 📋 Project Structure

```
ChatBot_python/
├── intents.json         # Training data with intents and responses
├── train_chatbot.py     # Script for training the neural network
├── chatbot.py           # Main chatbot implementation
├── words.pkl            # Serialized vocabulary (generated)
├── classes.pkl          # Serialized intent classes (generated)
├── chatbot_model.h5     # Trained neural network model
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Intent patterns are processed through tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization
2. **Model Training**: A neural network with multiple layers is trained to classify user input into predefined intents
3. **Response Selection**: Once an intent is identified, an appropriate response is selected
4. **Conversation Flow**: The chatbot maintains context to provide coherent multi-turn conversations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Dishant27/ChatBot_python.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd ChatBot_python

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model (if not using pre-trained model)
python train_chatbot.py

# Run the chatbot
python chatbot.py
```

## 💬 Example Conversation

```
User: Hello
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?

User: What can you do?
Bot: I can answer questions, provide information, or just chat with you. 
     Feel free to ask me about anything!

User: Tell me about machine learning
Bot: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
     building systems that learn from data. These systems improve their performance
     over time without being explicitly programmed to do so.
```

## 🔧 Customization

This ChatBot can be easily customized for specific domains or use cases:

1. Add your own intents and responses in `intents.json`
2. Modify the neural network architecture in `train_chatbot.py`
3. Retrain the model with your custom data
4. Implement domain-specific preprocessing or response generation

## 📈 Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement more advanced NLP techniques (transformers, word embeddings)
- [ ] Add voice recognition and speech synthesis
- [ ] Create a web interface or API for easier interaction
- [ ] Improve context handling for more natural conversations
- [ ] Integrate with external knowledge bases or APIs
